friendly_name: Clients First Seen
description: |-
  Picks out just the first observations per client.
  - Each attribute is retrieved from the ping that reports it
  first: Main, New profile or First Shutdown ping, and only
  updated from pings reported on the first-seen date.
  The only exceptions are the second_seen_date and the metadata
  reported pings which are updated daily in the case that data is
  reported later.

  This table should be accessed through the user-facing view
  `telemetry.clients_first_seen`.

  The initialization command creates the table and then inserts data
  in parallel for each sample_id. Usage:
  `bqetl query initialize sql/moz-fx-data-shared-prod/telemetry_derived/clients_first_seen_v2/query.sql`

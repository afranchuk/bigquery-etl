friendly_name: Gclid and GA Client ID Pairs
description: |-
  A mapping of GCLIDs to GA Client IDs
  Grain is one row per (gclid, ga_client_id) pair.

  A gclid is a google click id. It is a string
  that is used to identify an ad impression on
  Google's platform.

  A ga_client_id is an identifier that is stored
  in a cookie in the user's browser. It can be reset
  manually or through Google.

  We use these for post-install conversion events.

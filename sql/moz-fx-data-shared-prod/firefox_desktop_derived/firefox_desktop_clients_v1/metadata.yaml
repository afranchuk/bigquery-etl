friendly_name: Firefox Desktop Clients
description: |-
  First observations for Firefox Desktop clients, all channels.
  Retrieved from the earliest pings received: main, new_profile and first_shutdown.
  For all columns except attribution and download_token are retrieved from the esarliest
  new_profile_ping received.

  This table should be accessed through the user-facing view
  `firefox_desktop.firefox_desktop_clients`.

  For analysis purposes, use first_seen_date to query clients that
  effectively appeared on that date. The submission_date indicates
  when the server received the data.

  The query for this table overwrites the whole table instead of writing to
  a single partition, so manual backfills must use parameter --no_partition.

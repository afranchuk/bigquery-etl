        are expected known-good values, and means that the loaded bloomfilter matches
        the blocklist record in the RemoteSettings collection. The prefix denotes
        the immediate source of the loaded data: "dump" means packaged with the application,
        "remote" means a freshly downloaded bloomfilter, "cache" means a previously
        downloaded bloomfilter. "dump_fallback" and "cache_fallback" means that the
        last known bloomfilter was used, despite it not matching the latest record
        in the RemoteSettings collection. In this case the outdated bloomfilter is
        used as a fallback (e.g. because the latest version cannot be downloaded).
        "unknown"  means that the bloomfilter cannot be loaded at all. This can happen
        if the blocklist is disabled via preferences or enterprise policies.

We'll be using a simple test case (a small Glean application for which we want to generate an aggregated dataset based on the raw ping data) to illustrate the process. If you are interested in looking at the end result of this, you can view the pull request at mozilla/bigquery-etl#1760 . Background mozregression is a developer tool used to help developers and community members bisect builds of Firefox to find a regression range in which a bug was introduced. It forms a key part of our quality assurance process. While in some ways mozregression might seem dissimilar from, say, Firefox most of the concepts illustrated here will apply straightforwardly to the products we ship to customers which use (or will use) the Glean SDK. In this case, we want to create a simple table of aggregated metrics related to mozregression's use that we can use to power dashboards (to prioritize feature development internally inside Mozilla), as well as syndication as a public dataset . Initial steps Set up bigquery-etl on your system per the instructions in the README.md . Create the Query First, you'll need to create a query file to work off of. For this step, you'll need to know what you want your derived dataset to be called. In this case, we'll name it org_mozilla_mozregression_derived.mozregression_aggregates . The org_mozilla_mozregression_derived part represents a BigQuery dataset (a concept that is essentially a container of tables). By convention, we use the _derived postfix to hold derived tables like this one. Run: ./bqetl query create org_mozilla_mozregression_derived.mozregression_aggregates This will do a couple things: Generate some template files ( metadata.yaml , query.sql ) representing a query to build the dataset in sql/moz-fx-data-shared-prod/org_mozilla_mozregression_derived/mozregression_aggregates_v1 Generate a \"view\" of the dataset in sql/moz-fx-data-shared-prod/org_mozilla_mozregression/mozregression_aggregates . We generate the view to allow us to have a stable interface, while allowing us to evolve the backend details of a dataset over time. Views are automatically published to the mozdata project. Fill out the query The next step is to modify the generated metadata.yaml and query.sql sections with actual information. Let's look at the metadata.yaml first: friendly_name: mozregression aggregates description: > Aggregated metrics of mozregression usage labels: incremental: true public_json: true public_bigquery: true review_bugs: - 1691105 owners: - wlachance@mozilla.com Most of the fields are self-explanatory. incremental means that the table is updated incrementally, e.g. a new partition gets added/updated to the destination table whenever the query is run. For non-incremental queries the entire destination gets overwritten when the query is executed. You'll also note the public_json and public_bigquery fields: these mean that the dataset will be published in both Mozilla's public BigQuery project and a world-accessible JSON endpoint. The review_bugs section is required, and refers to the Bugzilla bug where opening this data set up to the public was approved: we'll get to that in a subsequent section. Now that we've filled out the metadata, we can look into creating a query. In many ways, this is similar to creating a SQL query to run on BigQuery in other contexts (e.g. on sql.telemetry.mozilla.org or the BigQuery console)-- the key difference is that we use a @submission_date parameter so that the query can be run on a day's worth of data to update the underlying table incrementally. After testing our query on sql.telemetry.mozilla.org, we'll write this query out to query.sql : SELECT DATE(submission_timestamp) AS date, client_info.app_display_version AS mozregression_version, metrics.string.usage_variant AS mozregression_variant, metrics.string.usage_app AS app_used, normalized_os AS os, mozfun.norm.truncate_version(normalized_os_version, \"minor\") AS os_version, count(DISTINCT(client_info.client_id)) AS distinct_clients, count(*) AS total_uses FROM `moz-fx-data-shared-prod`.org_mozilla_mozregression.usage WHERE DATE(submission_timestamp) = @submission_date AND client_info.app_display_version NOT LIKE '%.dev%' GROUP BY date, mozregression_version, mozregression_variant, app_used, os, os_version; We use the truncate_version UDF to omit the patch level for MacOS and Linux, which should both reduce the size of the dataset as well as make it more difficult to identify individual clients in an aggregated dataset. We also have a short clause ( client_info.app_display_version NOT LIKE '%.dev%' ) to omit developer versions from the aggregates: this makes sure we're not including people developing or testing mozregression itself in our results. Formatting and validating the query Now that we've written our query, we can format it and validate it. Once that's done, we run: ./bqetl query validate org_mozilla_mozregression_derived.mozregression_aggregates If there are no problems, you should see no output. Creating a DAG BigQuery-ETL has some facilities in it to automatically add your query to telemetry-airflow (our instance of Airflow). Before scheduling your query, you'll need to find an Airflow DAG to run it off of. In some cases, one may already exist that makes sense to use for your dataset -- look in dags.yaml at the root or run ./bqetl dag info . In this particular case, there's no DAG that really makes sense -- so we'll create a new one: ./bqetl dag create bqetl_internal_tooling --schedule-interval \"0 4 * * *\" --owner wlachance@mozilla.com --description \"This DAG schedules queries for populating queries related to Mozilla's internal developer tooling (e.g. mozregression).\" --start-date 2020-06-01 Most of the options above should be self-explanatory. We use a schedule interval of \"0 4 * * *\" (4am UTC daily) instead of \"daily\" (12am UTC daily) to make sure this isn't competing for slots with desktop and mobile product ETL. Scheduling your query Once again, you access this functionality via the bqetl tool: ./bqetl query schedule org_mozilla_mozregression_derived.mozregression_aggregates_v1 --dag bqetl_internal_tooling --task-name mozregression_aggregates__v1 Note that we are scheduling the generation of the underlying table which is org_mozilla_mozregression_derived.mozregression_aggregates_v1 rather than the view. After doing this, you will also want to generate the actual airflow configuration which telemetry-airflow will pick up. Run: ./bqetl dag generate bqetl_internal_tooling This may take a while, as it currently does a dry run through every query defined in bigquery-etl. Get Data Review This is for public datasets only! You can skip this step if you're only creating a dataset for Mozilla-internal use. Before a dataset can be made public, it needs to go through data review according to our data publishing process . This means filing a bug, answering a few questions, and then finding a data steward to review your proposal. The dataset we're using in this example is very simple and straightforward and doesn't have any particularly sensitive data, so the data review is very simple. You can see the full details in bug 1691105 . Create a Pull Request Now would be a good time to create a pull request with your changes to GitHub. This is the usual git workflow: git checkout -b mozregression-aggregates git add dags.yaml dags/bqetl_internal_tooling.py sql/moz-fx-data-shared-prod/telemetry/mozregression_aggregates sql/moz-fx-data-shared-prod/org_mozilla_mozregression_derived/mozregression_aggregates_v1 git commit git push origin mozregression-aggregates Then create your pull request, either from the GitHub web interface or the command line, per your preference. Note this example assumes that origin points to your fork. Adjust the last push invocation appropriately if you have a different remote set. Speaking of forks, note that if you're making this pull request from a fork, many jobs will currently fail due to lack of credentials. In fact, even if you're pushing to the origin, you'll get failures because the table is not yet created. That brings us to the next step, but before going further it's generally best to get someone to review your work: at this point we have more than enough for people to provide good feedback on. Creating an initial table To bootstrap an initial table, the normal best practice is to create another SQL file, similar to the incremental query above, which creates the table. We'll write out another file called init.sql in sql/moz-fx-data-shared-prod/org_mozilla_mozregression_derived/mozregression_aggregates_v1 : CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `mozilla-public-data`.org_mozilla_mozregression_derived.mozregression_aggregates PARTITION BY DATE(date) AS SELECT DATE(submission_timestamp) AS date, client_info.app_display_version AS mozregression_version, metrics.string.usage_variant AS mozregression_variant, metrics.string.usage_app AS app_used, normalized_os AS os, mozfun.norm.truncate_version(normalized_os_version, \"minor\") AS os_version, count(DISTINCT(client_info.client_id)) AS distinct_clients, count(*) AS total_uses FROM `moz-fx-data-shared-prod`.org_mozilla_mozregression.usage WHERE client_info.app_display_version NOT LIKE '%.dev%' GROUP BY date, mozregression_version, mozregression_variant, app_used, os, os_version; As the dataset will be published in both Mozilla's public BigQuery project, the table will need to be created in the mozilla-public-data project. Once the ETL is running, a view org_mozilla_mozregression_derived.mozregression_aggregates to the public table will be automatically created in moz-fx-data-shared-prod . Note the PARTITION BY DATE(date) in the statement. This makes it so BigQuery will partition the table by date. This isn't too big a deal for mozregression (where even the size of unaggregated data is very small) but can be a godsend for datasets where each day is hundreds of gigabytes or terabytes big . Go ahead and add this to your pull request. Now that we have an initial table definition, we can create a table using this command (if you're not in data engineering, you might have to get someone to run this for you as it implies modifying what we have in production): ./bqetl query initialize org_mozilla_mozregression_derived.mozregression_aggregates_v1 Backfilling your dataset In the above example, we actually created the entire history for the table in the initial query. But in many cases, this is not practical and you'd want to manually backfill the data, day-by-day. There are two options here: Backfill the table by triggering the Airflow DAG Using bqetl backfill The first approach is out of scope for this tutorial: you should talk to someone in Data Engineering or Data SRE if you want to do this. The second approach (which is normally pretty effective, at least if your underlying data isn't too big) is relatively straightforward though.

Now that we have an initial table definition, we can create a table using this command (if you're not in data engineering, you might have to get someone to run this for you as it implies modifying what we have in production): ./bqetl query initialize org_mozilla_mozregression_derived.mozregression_aggregates_v1","title":"Creating an initial table"},{"location":"cookbooks/creating_a_derived_dataset/#backfilling-your-dataset","text":"In the above example, we actually created the entire history for the table in the initial query. But in many cases, this is not practical and you'd want to manually backfill the data, day-by-day. There are two options here: Backfill the table by triggering the Airflow DAG Using bqetl backfill The first approach is out of scope for this tutorial: you should talk to someone in Data Engineering or Data SRE if you want to do this. The second approach (which is normally pretty effective, at least if your underlying data isn't too big) is relatively straightforward though.

There will be one row per client per submission_date . A given client will stop appearing for new dates if they do not send a main ping for 28 days. Generally, this is a direct product of clients_daily and serves to make certain query patterns more efficient by eliminating the need for self-joins that would otherwise be needed to consider windows of activity. As an exception, it pulls in first_seen_date and second_seen_date over all time from clients_first_seen since first_seen_date is highly valuable for providing a stable definition of when a profile was created.

It contains only the most recent six months of data. Queries on this table are logically equivalent to queries on top of main_v4 with a filter on sample_id = 0 , but this table has a few advantages. First, query estimates will be much more accurate; estimates of bytes scanned can't take into account clustering, so we sometimes see valid queries get rejected by Redash due to appearing expensive when they really aren't. Second, simple queries should complete much more quickly on this table compared to main_v4 ; for simple queries on a very wide table like this, the execution time appears to be dominated by BQ simply scanning metadata for all the blocks it might need to touch. Because this table contains only 1% of main ping data, it is likely to have many fewer blocks to scan through. An extra-experimental feature here is the addition of subsample_id, an additional clustering field that allows for queries to efficiently filter down to a 0.01% sample.

First, query estimates will be much more accurate; estimates of bytes scanned can't take into account clustering, so we sometimes see valid queries get rejected by Redash due to appearing expensive when they really aren't. Second, simple queries should complete much more quickly on this table compared to main_v4 ; for simple queries on a very wide table like this, the execution time appears to be dominated by BQ simply scanning metadata for all the blocks it might need to touch. Because this table contains only 1% of main ping data, it is likely to have many fewer blocks to scan through. An extra-experimental feature here is the addition of subsample_id, an additional clustering field that allows for queries to efficiently filter down to a 0.01% sample.

WARNING: THIS FUNCTION IS NOT RELIABLE FOR ARBITRARY GZIP STREAMS. It should, however, be safe to use for checking the decompressed size of payload in payload_bytes_decoded (and NOT payload_bytes_raw) because that payload is produced by the decoder and limited to conditions where the footer is accurate. From https://stackoverflow.com/a/9213826 First, the only information about the uncompressed length is four bytes at the end of the gzip file (stored in little-endian order). By necessity, that is the length modulo 232. So if the uncompressed length is 4 GB or more, you won't know what the length is. You can only be certain that the uncompressed length is less than 4 GB if the compressed length is less than something like 232 / 1032 + 18, or around 4 MB. (1032 is the maximum compression factor of deflate.) Second, and this is worse, a gzip file may actually be a concatenation of multiple gzip streams. Other than decoding, there is no way to find where each gzip stream ends in order to look at the four-byte uncompressed length of that piece. (Which may be wrong anyway due to the first reason.) Third, gzip files will sometimes have junk after the end of the gzip stream (usually zeros). Then the last four bytes are not the length.

It should, however, be safe to use for checking the decompressed size of payload in payload_bytes_decoded (and NOT payload_bytes_raw) because that payload is produced by the decoder and limited to conditions where the footer is accurate. From https://stackoverflow.com/a/9213826 First, the only information about the uncompressed length is four bytes at the end of the gzip file (stored in little-endian order). By necessity, that is the length modulo 232. So if the uncompressed length is 4 GB or more, you won't know what the length is. You can only be certain that the uncompressed length is less than 4 GB if the compressed length is less than something like 232 / 1032 + 18, or around 4 MB. (1032 is the maximum compression factor of deflate.) Second, and this is worse, a gzip file may actually be a concatenation of multiple gzip streams. Other than decoding, there is no way to find where each gzip stream ends in order to look at the four-byte uncompressed length of that piece. (Which may be wrong anyway due to the first reason.) Third, gzip files will sometimes have junk after the end of the gzip stream (usually zeros). Then the last four bytes are not the length.

The events_daily table is created as a result of two steps: 1. Map each event to a single UTF8 char which will represent it 2. Group each client-day and store a string that records, using the compressed format, that clients' event history for that day. The characters are ordered by the timestamp which they appeared that day. The best way to access this data is to create a view to do the heavy lifting. For example, to see which clients completed a certain action, you can create a view using these functions that knows what that action's representation is (using the compressed mapping from 1.) and create a regex string that checks for the presence of that event. The view makes this transparent, and allows users to simply query a boolean field representing the presence of that event on that day. extract_event_counts (UDF) Extract the events and their counts from an events string.

This view will be in the shared-prod project, in the analysis bucket, and so will be queryable at: sql `moz-fx-data-shared-prod`.analysis.{view_name} project : The project where the dataset is located. dataset : The dataset that must contain both the events_daily and event_types tables. funnels : An array of funnels that will be created. Each funnel has two parts: funnel_name : The name of the funnel is what the column representing the funnel will be named in the view. For example, with the value \"onboarding\" , the view can be selected as follows: sql SELECT onboarding FROM `moz-fx-data-shared-prod`.analysis.{view_name} funnel : The ordered series of steps that make up a funnel. Each step also has: step_name : Used to name the column within the funnel and represents whether the user completed that step on that day. For example, within onboarding a user may have completed_first_card as a step; this can be queried at sql SELECT onboarding.completed_first_step FROM `moz-fx-data-shared-prod`.analysis.{view_name} events : The set of events which indicate the user completed that step of the funnel. Most of the time this is a single event. Each event has a category and event_name . counts : An array of counts. Each count has two parts, similar to funnel steps: count_name : Used to name the column representing the event count. E.g. \"clicked_settings_count\" would be queried at sql SELECT clicked_settings_count FROM `moz-fx-data-shared-prod`.analysis.{view_name} events : The set of events you want to count. Each event has a category and event_name . Recommended Pattern Because the view definitions themselves are not informative about the contents of the events fields, it is best to put your query immediately after the procedure invocation, rather than invoking the procedure and running a separate query. This STMO query is an example of doing so. This allows viewers of the query to easily interpret what the funnel and count columns represent. Structure of the Resulting View The view will be created at `moz-fx-data-shared-prod`.analysis.{event_name}. The view will have a schema roughly matching the following: root |-- submission_date: date |-- client_id: string |-- {funnel_1_name}: record | |-- {funnel_step_1_name} boolean | |-- {funnel_step_2_name} boolean ... |-- {funnel_N_name}: record | |-- {funnel_step_M_name}: boolean |-- {count_1_name}: integer ... |-- {count_N_name}: integer ...dimensions... Funnels Each funnel will be a STRUCT with nested columns representing completion of each step The types of those columns are boolean, and represent whether the user completed that step on that day. STRUCT( completed_step_1 BOOLEAN, completed_step_2 BOOLEAN, ... ) AS funnel_name With one row per-user per-day, you can use COUNTIF(funnel_name.completed_step_N) to query these fields. See below for an example. Event Counts Each event count is simply an INT64 representing the number of times the user completed those events on that day. If there are multiple events represented within one count, the values are summed. For example, if you wanted to know the number of times a user opened or closed the app, you could create a single event count with those two events. event_count_name INT64 Examples The following creates a few fields: - collection_flow is a funnel for those that started creating a collection within Fenix, and then finished, either by adding those tabs to an existing collection or saving it as a new collection. - collection_flow_saved represents users who started the collection flow then saved it as a new collection. - number_of_collections_created is the number of collections created - number_of_collections_deleted is the number of collections deleted CALL mozfun.event_analysis.create_events_view( 'fenix_collection_funnels', 'moz-fx-data-shared-prod', 'org_mozilla_firefox', -- Funnels [ STRUCT( \"collection_flow\" AS funnel_name, [STRUCT( \"started_collection_creation\" AS step_name, [STRUCT('collections' AS category, 'tab_select_opened' AS event_name)] AS events), STRUCT( \"completed_collection_creation\" AS step_name, [STRUCT('collections' AS category, 'saved' AS event_name), STRUCT('collections' AS category, 'tabs_added' AS event_name)] AS events) ] AS funnel), STRUCT( \"collection_flow_saved\" AS funnel_name, [STRUCT( \"started_collection_creation\" AS step_name, [STRUCT('collections' AS category, 'tab_select_opened' AS event_name)] AS events), STRUCT( \"saved_collection\" AS step_name, [STRUCT('collections' AS category, 'saved' AS event_name)] AS events) ] AS funnel) ], -- Event Counts [ STRUCT( \"number_of_collections_created\" AS count_name, [STRUCT('collections' AS category, 'saved' AS event_name)] AS events ), STRUCT( \"number_of_collections_deleted\" AS count_name, [STRUCT('collections' AS category, 'removed' AS event_name)] AS events ) ] ); From there, you can query a few things. For example, the fraction of users who completed each step of the collection flow over time: SELECT submission_date, COUNTIF(collection_flow.started_collection_creation) / COUNT(*) AS started_collection_creation, COUNTIF(collection_flow.completed_collection_creation) / COUNT(*) AS completed_collection_creation, FROM `moz-fx-data-shared-prod`.analysis.fenix_collection_funnels WHERE submission_date >= DATE_SUB(current_date, INTERVAL 28 DAY) GROUP BY submission_date Or you can see the number of collections created and deleted: SELECT submission_date, SUM(number_of_collections_created) AS number_of_collections_created, SUM(number_of_collections_deleted) AS number_of_collections_deleted, FROM `moz-fx-data-shared-prod`.analysis.fenix_collection_funnels WHERE submission_date >= DATE_SUB(current_date, INTERVAL 28 DAY) GROUP BY submission_date Source | Edit extract_event_counts_with_properties (UDF) Extract events with event properties and their associated counts.

By themselves, these two tables are nearly impossible to use since the event history is compressed; however, these stored procedures should make the data accessible. The events_daily table is created as a result of two steps: 1. Map each event to a single UTF8 char which will represent it 2. Group each client-day and store a string that records, using the compressed format, that clients' event history for that day. The characters are ordered by the timestamp which they appeared that day. The best way to access this data is to create a view to do the heavy lifting. For example, to see which clients completed a certain action, you can create a view using these functions that knows what that action's representation is (using the compressed mapping from 1.) and create a regex string that checks for the presence of that event.

Thus, this function serves as a bridge to get from legacy application identifiers to the consistent identifiers we are using for reporting in 2021. As of 2021, most Mozilla products are sending telemetry via the Glean SDK, with Glean telemetry in active development for desktop Firefox as well. The probeinfo API is the single source of truth for metadata about applications sending Glean telemetry; the values for app_name and canonical_app_name returned here correspond to the \"end-to-end identifier\" values documented in the v2 Glean app listings endpoint . For non-Glean telemetry, we provide values in the same style to provide continuity as we continue the migration to Glean. For legacy telemetry pings like main ping for desktop and core ping for mobile products, the legacy_app_name given as input to this function should come from the submission URI (stored as metadata.uri.app_name in BigQuery ping tables). For Glean pings, we have invented product values that can be passed in to this function as the legacy_app_name parameter. The returned app_name values are intended to be readable and unambiguous, but short and easy to type. They are suitable for use as a key in derived tables. product is a deprecated field that was similar in intent. The returned canonical_app_name is more verbose and is suited for displaying in visualizations. canonical_name is a synonym that we provide for historical compatibility with previous versions of this function. The returned struct also contains boolean contributes_to_2021_kpi as the canonical reference for whether the given application is included in KPI reporting. Additional fields may be added for future years. The normalized_os value that's passed in should be the top-level normalized_os value present in any ping table or you may want to wrap a raw value in mozfun.norm.os like mozfun.norm.product_info(app_name, mozfun.norm.os(os)) . This function also tolerates passing in a product value as legacy_app_name so that this function is still useful for derived tables which have thrown away the raw app_name value from legacy pings.

Source | Edit fenix_app_info (UDF) Returns canonical, human-understandable identification info for Fenix sources. The Glean telemetry library for Android by design routes pings based on the Play Store appId value of the published application. As of August 2020, there have been 5 separate Play Store appId values associated with different builds of Fenix, each corresponding to different datasets in BigQuery, and the mapping of appId to logical app names (Firefox vs. Firefox Preview) and channel names (nightly, beta, or release) has changed over time; see the spreadsheet of naming history for Mozilla's mobile browsers .> This function is intended as the source of truth for how to map a specific ping in BigQuery to a logical app names and channel. It should be expected that the output of this function may evolve over time. If we rename a product or channel, we may choose to update the values here so that analyses consistently get the new name. The first argument ( app_id ) can be fairly fuzzy; it is tolerant of actual Google Play Store appId values like 'org.mozilla.firefox_beta' (mix of periods and underscores) as well as BigQuery dataset names with suffixes like 'org_mozilla_firefox_beta_stable'. The second argument ( app_build_id ) should be the value in client_info.app_build. The function returns a STRUCT that contains the logical app_name and channel as well as the Play Store app_id in the canonical form which would appear in Play Store URLs. Note that the naming of Fenix applications changed on 2020-07-03, so to get a continuous view of the pings associated with a logical app channel, you may need to union together tables from multiple BigQuery datasets. To see data for all Fenix channels together, it is necessary to union together tables from all 5 datasets. For basic usage information, consider using telemetry.fenix_clients_last_seen which already handles the union. Otherwise, see the example below as a template for how construct a custom union. Mapping of channels to datasets: release: org_mozilla_firefox beta: org_mozilla_firefox_beta (current) and org_mozilla_fenix nightly: org_mozilla_fenix (current), org_mozilla_fennec_aurora , and org_mozilla_fenix_nightly -- Example of a query over all Fenix builds advertised as \"Firefox Beta\" CREATE TEMP FUNCTION extract_fields(app_id STRING, m ANY TYPE) AS ( ( SELECT AS STRUCT m.submission_timestamp, m.metrics.string.geckoview_version, mozfun.norm.fenix_app_info(app_id, m.client_info.app_build).* ) ); WITH base AS ( SELECT extract_fields('org_mozilla_firefox_beta', m).* FROM org_mozilla_firefox_beta.metrics AS m UNION ALL SELECT extract_fields('org_mozilla_fenix', m).* FROM org_mozilla_fenix.metrics AS m ) SELECT DATE(submission_timestamp) AS submission_date, geckoview_version, COUNT(*) FROM base WHERE app_name = 'Fenix' -- excludes 'Firefox Preview' AND channel = 'beta' AND DATE(submission_timestamp) = '2020-08-01' GROUP BY submission_date, geckoview_version Source | Edit os (UDF) Normalize an operating system string to one of the three major desktop platforms, one of the two major mobile platforms, or \"Other\". This is a reimplementation of logic used in the data pipeline > to populate normalized_os . Source | Edit glean_baseline_client_info (UDF) Accepts a glean client_info struct as input and returns a modified struct that includes a few parsed or normalized variants of the input fields. Source | Edit truncate_version (UDF) Truncates a version string like <major>.<minor>.<patch> to either the major or minor version. The return value is NUMERIC , which means that you can sort the results without fear (e.g. 100 will be categorized as greater than 80, which isn't the case when sorting lexigraphically). For example, \"5.1.0\" would be translated to 5.1 if the parameter is \"minor\" or 5 if the parameter is major. If the version is only a major and/or minor version, then it will be left unchanged (for example \"10\" would stay as 10 when run through this function, no matter what the arguments). This is useful for grouping Linux and Mac operating system versions inside aggregate datasets or queries where there may be many different patch releases in the field.

Thus, this function serves as a bridge to get from legacy application identifiers to the consistent identifiers we are using for reporting in 2021. As of 2021, most Mozilla products are sending telemetry via the Glean SDK, with Glean telemetry in active development for desktop Firefox as well. The probeinfo API is the single source of truth for metadata about applications sending Glean telemetry; the values for app_name and canonical_app_name returned here correspond to the \"end-to-end identifier\" values documented in the v2 Glean app listings endpoint . For non-Glean telemetry, we provide values in the same style to provide continuity as we continue the migration to Glean. For legacy telemetry pings like main ping for desktop and core ping for mobile products, the legacy_app_name given as input to this function should come from the submission URI (stored as metadata.uri.app_name in BigQuery ping tables). For Glean pings, we have invented product values that can be passed in to this function as the legacy_app_name parameter. The returned app_name values are intended to be readable and unambiguous, but short and easy to type. They are suitable for use as a key in derived tables. product is a deprecated field that was similar in intent. The returned canonical_app_name is more verbose and is suited for displaying in visualizations. canonical_name is a synonym that we provide for historical compatibility with previous versions of this function. The returned struct also contains boolean contributes_to_2021_kpi as the canonical reference for whether the given application is included in KPI reporting. Additional fields may be added for future years. The normalized_os value that's passed in should be the top-level normalized_os value present in any ping table or you may want to wrap a raw value in mozfun.norm.os like mozfun.norm.product_info(app_name, mozfun.norm.os(os)) . This function also tolerates passing in a product value as legacy_app_name so that this function is still useful for derived tables which have thrown away the raw app_name value from legacy pings.

The Glean telemetry library for Android by design routes pings based on the Play Store appId value of the published application. As of August 2020, there have been 5 separate Play Store appId values associated with different builds of Fenix, each corresponding to different datasets in BigQuery, and the mapping of appId to logical app names (Firefox vs. Firefox Preview) and channel names (nightly, beta, or release) has changed over time; see the spreadsheet of naming history for Mozilla's mobile browsers .> This function is intended as the source of truth for how to map a specific ping in BigQuery to a logical app names and channel. It should be expected that the output of this function may evolve over time. If we rename a product or channel, we may choose to update the values here so that analyses consistently get the new name. The first argument ( app_id ) can be fairly fuzzy; it is tolerant of actual Google Play Store appId values like 'org.mozilla.firefox_beta' (mix of periods and underscores) as well as BigQuery dataset names with suffixes like 'org_mozilla_firefox_beta_stable'. The second argument ( app_build_id ) should be the value in client_info.app_build. The function returns a STRUCT that contains the logical app_name and channel as well as the Play Store app_id in the canonical form which would appear in Play Store URLs. Note that the naming of Fenix applications changed on 2020-07-03, so to get a continuous view of the pings associated with a logical app channel, you may need to union together tables from multiple BigQuery datasets.
